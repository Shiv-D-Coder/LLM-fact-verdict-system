India continues to scale its digital governance capabilities through multiple inter-ministerial initiatives. In 2024, the Ministry of Rural Development expanded the e-GramSwaraj platform, enabling Panchayats to upload expenditure patterns, development milestones, and planning data in real time. BharatNet Phase III aims to bring last-mile fiber connectivity to an additional set of underserved rural regions. The government has also strengthened payment infrastructure with NPCI partnerships, expanded digital skilling initiatives for rural youth, and released updated standards for cybersecurity and responsible data sharing. Meanwhile, efforts such as the National AI Mission and the IndiaAI Compute Framework support AI adoption across public services. These policies collectively aim to deliver faster public service delivery, improved transparency, and a secure digital ecosystem for citizens.
