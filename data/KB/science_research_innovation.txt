India’s research and scientific institutions continue to expand their innovation footprint through conferences, collaborative events, and national festivals. In late 2025, CSIR-NIScPR and CSIR-NPL jointly organized the curtain raiser for the India International Science Festival 2025, focusing on advancing public engagement with science, space technology, and scientific literacy. CCRAS launched SIDDHI 2.0, a major initiative aimed at strengthening research-driven innovation within the Ayurveda pharmaceutical sector. The event highlighted modern clinical validation methods, quality assurance frameworks, and industry collaborations. Additional scientific dialogues included sessions on AI-driven filmmaking, youth innovation showcases, and the recognition of scientific achievements across multiple fields. These initiatives underscore the government’s focus on bridging traditional knowledge systems, modern research frameworks, and emerging technologies.
