The Government of India has continued to expand support mechanisms for farmers across multiple domains, ranging from crop procurement to subsidy reforms. The PM Kisan scheme was enhanced in 2024 to include tenant farmers based on state-verified documentation. Investments in climate-resilient crop varieties, fertilizer subsidies, and micro-irrigation infrastructure under PMKSY remain ongoing. Additionally, a nationwide farmer credit outreach campaign was launched in early 2024 to streamline Kisan Credit Card approvals. The government is also currently piloting digital soil health cards using geotagged sampling to improve long-term soil productivity. These initiatives collectively aim to strengthen agricultural productivity while encouraging sustainable farming practices.
