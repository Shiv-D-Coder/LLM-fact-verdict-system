The Ministry of Power continues to announce reforms to modernize India's electricity distribution ecosystem. Recent guidelines issued in June 2024 encourage all states to transition to smart prepaid electricity meters by 2026. These measures aim to reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses and improve billing transparency. While many state governments independently provide subsidized or partially waived electricity for farmers, no nationwide policy currently guarantees free electricity to all farmers. Subsidy structures vary widely and depend heavily on state-level budget allocation, agricultural consumption, and local economic needs. Central schemes such as the PM Kusum program and the Solarization of Agricultural Feeders focus on reducing long-term power costs for the agriculture sector through renewable energy adoption. The Government also launched the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana in early 2024, offering up to 300 units of free electricity for households adopting rooftop solar, though this scheme does not apply specifically to farmers as a nationwide entitlement.
