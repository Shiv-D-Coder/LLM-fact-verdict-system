A series of national cultural and governance-related events took place in November 2025, reflecting India's continued focus on heritage, democratic participation, and creative industries. On Constitution Day, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the framers of the Constitution and addressed citizens through an open letter emphasizing democratic values and civic participation. Several major events were showcased at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), including the launch of India’s first AI Film Festival, the Cinema AI Hackathon awards, and insights from Chris Corbould, the renowned SFX artist behind James Bond and Batman films. Cultural exhibitions such as ‘Vanya’ and ‘Bindusagar’ highlighted storytelling rooted in nature and human experience. Additionally, administrative institutions such as PDUNASS hosted governance dialogues, and ministries held review meetings on economic, administrative, and financial compliance topics. These events collectively illustrate the government's commitment to cultural promotion, creative innovation, and public governance reform.
